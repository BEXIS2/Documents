# Modules (full + client only) & Tool Overview

This page contains modules which have been developed by the BEXIS2 community. Currently, they are provided "as is" without any warranty or liability. Please use at you own risk.

Most of the modules are constantly under development and are not (yet) provided as releases that match the official BEXIS2 releases. We hope to get there in the future. For the time being, if you are interested in using a module please contact the individual provider and to learn about the current status and how to use the module.
