My Data is the dashboard that provides an overview of all datasets you have access to. It serves as a starting point for viewing and modifying your datasets ([My Datasets](#my-datasets)), tracking your data requests ([My Requests](#my-requests)), and managing access requests from other users for your datasets ([Decisions](decisions)).

## Dashboard
### My Datasets
__My Datasets__ provides you with an overview of all datasets you have access to and serves as a starting point for viewing and modifying your datasets. Depending on the instance, there may only be one section (dataset) or multiple sections (e.g., dataset, publications). 
Each section presents datasets in a table with different views based on permissions. By default, these permission groups are:

* __Own:__ Full access, including the ability to grant permissions
* __Edit:__ Edit access without permission management
* __Download:__ Read-only access with download capability
  
(Note: These groups may be configured differently in some instances.)

__Editing Datasets__

In the My Datasets view, you will find general information about your datasets (e.g., ID, title) and options to manage them. Datasets highlighted in red contain incomplete metadata.

The action buttons on the right side provide the following options:
* __View:__ Opens the dataset in a new tab. 
* __Edit:__ Opens the [Dataset Edit Page](../docs/Datasets/#metadata-edit-page) in a new tab
* __Copy:__ Creates a duplicate of your dataset and opens the Edit Page for the new dataset. The copied dataset retains the same metadata and data structure as the original but does not include primary data, attachments, or links. You should choose this option if you want to reuse the metadata and/or data structure.
* __Versioning__ â€“ set a tag _(not available in all instances)_: Opens the [version table](#dataset-versioning) of the dataset, allowing you to set tags for major and minor versions (optional), depending on the instance settings for your dataset.


### My Requests
My Requests lists all your pending and answered data access requests. You can withdraw pending requests no longer valid by clicking the trash bin button on the right. For more information on how to request data access, click [here](#..docs/Search/#request-data-access).
