## Registration

To register, click **Register** in the top main menu. Fill out the form completely — all fields are required. You must agree to the **Terms and Conditions**, and are asked to **carefully read the Privacy Policy**.

After completing the form, click the **Register** button at the bottom of the form to submit your registration.  
You will then receive an email with a link to **confirm your email address** and to **complete your profile**. Depending on the setting of your instance, you will be asked to provide some additional details, such as your **name**, your **role in the project**, and your **affiliated organization**.

Based on this information, the **administrator of your instance** will review your request and grant appropriate access permissions in due time.

## Login

To login, click **Login** in the main menu. On the login page, you have to enter your account credentials (**email or username** and **password**).  
If the login is successful, the start page (e.g., **Search**) is loaded. Otherwise, you will see information about the status and reason for the failed login.

## API Token

In general, two mechanisms, authentication and authorization protect the APIs of BEXIS2. Unlike logon, which uses the usual credentials, the APIs use a personalized token for authentication. The token can be found in the user menu.
