## Registration

The registration form is accessible via the Register button on the right side. All fields of the form are mandatory, and it is required to agree to the *Terms and Conditions* and *Privacy Policy*. Then you are asked to confirm your email address. As the last step, you have to provide some information (e.g.,  name, affiliation to the project, organization). Based on the provided details, the project Team grants permissions within three days.

## Login

Press the *Login* button on the right side. BEXIS2 redirects you to the login form, where you have to enter your account credentials (email or username and password). If the login is successful, the start page (e.g., *Dashboard* or *Search*) is loaded. Otherwise, you will see information about the status and reason for the failed login.

## Dataset permissions

## API Token

In general, two mechanisms, authentication and authorization protect the APIs of BEXIS2. Unlike logon, which uses the usual credentials, the APIs use a personalized token for authentication. The token can be found in the user menu.
